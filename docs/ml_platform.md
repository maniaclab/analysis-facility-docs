The [atlas-ml.org](https://www.atlas-ml.org/) service, part of the ATLAS Distributed Computing analytics and [monitoring](https://adc-monitoring.web.cern.ch/) effort, was developed to provide GPU resources for algorithm development for system metadata collected by the [Elasticsearch cluster](https://atlas-kibana.mwt2.org:5601/) at UChicago.
